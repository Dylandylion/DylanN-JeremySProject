# README

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is an application I created to learn different aspects of a web application. 
The idea of the project was to create an aggregator simiar to AutoTempest,eBay, or Carvanna, except for Homestays.
There are a few glaring issues and functionalities that have not been implemented.
    1)Lack of API AirBnB or Vrbo. *Some links may be stale.
    2)Lack of working search bar.
    3)Implmentation of Google Map API for visual markers.
    
    
    Utilized:
        HTML for initial outline.
        Bootstrap for front end development
        CSS for additional stylization of application
        Embedded Ruby along with Rails to produce a table reflective of available homestays
        Boolean logic to allow certain functionalities
